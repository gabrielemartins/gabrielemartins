### Hello World! 

My name is Gabriele Martins and I'm a developer intern.

Here in my Github profile you can find my studies journey. I'm open to any improvement opportunities and tips.   

*obs: my current work hasn't been here for a while, but at my company profile at other host service ;)*

If you want to talk to me, you can find me here. ðŸ™‚
